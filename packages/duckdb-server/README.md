# Mosaic DuckDB Server

[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/duckdb-server.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/duckdb-server/)

A Python-based server that runs a local DuckDB instance and support queries over Web Sockets or HTTP, returning data in either [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) or JSON format.

_Note:_ This package provides a local DuckDB server. To instead use DuckDB-WASM in the browser, use the `wasmConnector` in the [`mosaic-core`](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic/tree/main/packages/mosaic-core) package.

## Installation and usage

We recommend running the server in an isolated environment with [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx). For example, to directly run the server, use:

```bash
pipx run duckdb-server
```

Alternatively, you can install the server with `pip install duckdb-server`. Then you can start the server with `duckdb-server`.

## Developer Setup

We use [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) to manage our development setup.

Start the server in development with `hatch run serve`. The server restarts when you change the code.

To run the tests, use `hatch run test:cov`.

To set up a local certificate for SSL, use https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert.

## API

The server supports queries via HTTP GET and POST, and WebSockets. The GET endpoint is useful for debugging. For example, you can query it with [this url](<http://localhost:3000/?query={"sql":"select 1","type":"json"}>).

Each endpoint takes a JSON object with a command in the `type`. The server supports the following commands.

### `exec`

Executes the SQL query in the `sql` field.

### `arrow`

Executes the SQL query in the `sql` field and returns the result in Apache Arrow format.

### `json`

Executes the SQL query in the `sql` field and returns the result in JSON format.

### `create-bundle`

Caches the results of the SQL queries in the `queries` field and the required datasets.

### `load-bundle`

Loads the bundled results.

## Publishing

Run the build with `hatch build`. Then publish with `hatch publish`. We publish using tokens so when asked, set the username to `__token__` and then use your token as the password. Alternatively, create a [`.pypirc` file](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#create-an-account).
