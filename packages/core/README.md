# mosaic-core

The core Mosaic components: a central coordinator, parameters (`Param`) and selections (`Selection`) for linking scalar values or query predicates (respectively) across Mosaic clients, and filter groups with optimized index management. The Mosaic coordinator can send queries either over the network to a backing server (`socket` and `rest` clients) or to a client-side [DuckDB-WASM](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-wasm) instance (`wasm` client).

The `mosaic-core` facilities are included as part of the [vgplot](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic/tree/main/packages/vgplot) API.
