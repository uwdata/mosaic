# DuckDB Go Server

A Go-based server that runs a local DuckDB instance and support queries over Web Sockets or HTTP/HTTPS, returning data in either [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) or JSON format.

_Note:_ This package provides a local DuckDB server. To instead use DuckDB-WASM in the browser, use the `wasmConnector` in the [`mosaic-core`](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic/tree/main/packages/mosaic/mosaic-core) package.

## Usage

Install the server with `go install`.

```sh
go install -tags=duckdb_arrow github.com/uwdata/mosaic/packages/server/duckdb-server-go@latest
```

Then run the server with

```sh
duckdb-server-go
```

### Command-Line Options

You can customize the server behavior with the following command-line flags:

-   `--database <path>`: Path to a DuckDB database file (e.g., "database.db"). Defaults to an in-memory database.
-   `--address <address>`: The HTTP address to listen on. Defaults to "localhost".
-   `--port <port>`: The HTTP port to listen on. Defaults to "3000".
-   `--connection-pool-size <size>`: The maximum size of the connection pool. Defaults to 10.
-   `--cache-size <size>`: The maximum number of cache entries. Defaults to 1000.
-   `--cert <path>`: Path to a TLS certificate file to enable HTTPS.
-   `--key <path>`: Path to a TLS private key file to enable HTTPS.

By default, the server will look for `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem` in the current directory to enable HTTPS if the `--cert` and `--key` flags are not provided.

Create certificates for localhost with [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)

```sh
mkcert -install # Install mkcert CA
mkcert localhost # create localhost.pem and localhost-key.pem
```

## API

The server supports queries via HTTP GET and POST, and WebSockets. The GET endpoint is useful for debugging. For example, you can query it with [this url](<http://localhost:3000/?query={"sql":"select 1","type":"json"}>).

Each endpoint takes a JSON object with a command in the `type`. The server supports the following commands.

### `exec`

Executes the SQL query in the `sql` field.

### `arrow`

Executes the SQL query in the `sql` field and returns the result in Apache Arrow format.

### `json`

Executes the SQL query in the `sql` field and returns the result in JSON format.

## Developers

### Build

Build the release binary with:

```sh
go build -o duckdb-server-go .
```

### Develop

To run the server, use `go run` (this won't restart when the code changes):

```sh
go run -tags=duckdb_arrow .
```

Before sending a pull request, run the tests, linter, and formatter:

```sh
go fmt ./...
go test -tags=duckdb_arrow ./...
golangci-lint run
```

### Update Dependencies

Update dependencies with `go get -u` and then run `go mod tidy` to clean up the `go.mod` file.
