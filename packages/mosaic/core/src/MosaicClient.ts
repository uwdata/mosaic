 *

 * initialization (potentially involving queries for data schema and summary
 * statistic information), and then interactive queries that may be driven by
 * an associated selection. When no longer needed, a client should be
 * disconnected from the coordinator.
 *
 * When enabled, a client will initialize and respond to query update requests.
 * If disabled, the client will delay initialization and not respond to queries
 * until enabled again. Disabling a client can improve system performance when
 * associated interface elements are offscreen or disabled.
