   * series via the **z**, **fill**, or **stroke** channel, series are drawn in
   * input order such that the last series is drawn on top. Typically *data* is
   * already in sorted order, such as chronological for time series; if needed,
   * consider a **sort** transform.
   *
   * If any **x** or **y** values are invalid (undefined, null, or NaN), the
   * line will be interrupted, resulting in a break that divides the line shape
   * into multiple segments. If a line segment consists of only a single point,
   * it may appear invisible unless rendered with rounded or square line caps.
   * In addition, some curves such as *cardinal-open* only render a visible
   * segment if it contains multiple points.
   *
   * Variable aesthetic channels are supported: if the **stroke** is defined as
   * a channel, the line will be broken into contiguous overlapping segments
   * when the stroke color changes; the stroke color will apply to the interval
   * spanning the current data point and the following data point. This
   * behavior also applies to the **fill**, **fillOpacity**, **strokeOpacity**,
   * **strokeWidth**, **opacity**, **href**, **title**, and **ariaLabel**
   * channels. When any of these channels are used, setting an explicit **z**
   * channel (possibly to null) is strongly recommended.
