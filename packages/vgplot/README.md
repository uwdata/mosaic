# vgplot: A Mosaic-powered Visualization Grammar

A **v**isualization **g**rammar for interactive Mosaic-powered visualizations and dashboards. This package provides convenient, composable methods that combines multiple Mosaic packages (core, inputs, plot, etc.) in an integrated API.

vgplot is a JavaScript API for creating visualizations and dashboards. See the [mosaic-spec](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic/tree/main/packages/spec) package to instead use declarative specifications in JSON or YAML format.
