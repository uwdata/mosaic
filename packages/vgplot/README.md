# @mosaic/vgplot

A prototype visualization grammar implemented on top of [Observable Plot](https://github.com/observablehq/plot), in which marks (plot layers) are individual Mosaic clients. These marks can push data processing (binning, hex binning, regression) and optimizations (such as M4 for line/area charts) down to the database.
