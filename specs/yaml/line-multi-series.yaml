  title: Line Multi-Series
  description: >
    This line chart shows the unemployment rate of various U.S. metro divisions
    from 2000 through 2013. On hover, the closest data point to the pointer and
    its associated series is highlighted. Highlighting of series is performed
    using `nearestX` and `highlight` interactors. Point and text annotations
    instead use the mark `select` filter option.
