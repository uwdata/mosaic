# Line Density

The `denseLine` mark shows the densities of line series, here for a collection of stock prices.
The top plot normalizes by arc length to remove the vertical artifacts visible in the unnormalized plot below.
Select a region in the lower plot to zoom the upper plot.
The bandwidth slider smooths the data, while the bin width menu adjusts the raster resolution.
