# Get Started

## Use in JavaScript

Include the desired Mosaic libraries in your project dependencies and import them as part of your application. To access the central coordinator, use the `coordinator()` method, which is exported by  [Mosaic core](/core/) and also re-exported by [Mosaic vgplot](/vgplot/).

The snippet below imports vgplot, configures the coordinator to use DuckDB-WASM as the backing database, and creates a plot with a single `areaY` mark to produce a time-series chart for the database table `"stocks"`.

``` js
import * as vg from "@uwdata/vgplot";

// configure the coordinator to use DuckDB-WASM
const wasm = await vg.wasmConnector();
vg.coordinator().databaseConnector(wasm);

// load data into the database
// executes a query generated by the loadCSV helper
vg.coordinator().exec(vg.loadCSV("stocks", "stock-data.csv"));

// create an area chart, returned as an HTML element
// you might subsequently add this to your webpage
const chart = vg.plot(
  vg.areaY(vg.from("stocks"), { x: "Date", y: "Price" })
);
```

For a working standalone example, take a look at the [Cross-Filter Flights 10M notebook](https://observablehq.com/@uwdata/mosaic-cross-filter-flights-10m) on Observable.

## Use in Python + Jupyter

To create scalable visualizations within Jupyter notebooks, you can use [Mosaic vgplot](/vgplot/) specifications in either YAML or JSON format. See the [Jupyter widget](/jupyter/) docs for more.

## Run and develop locally

To run Mosaic examples on a local DuckDB server or work on Mosaic development, make a local clone of the [Mosaic GitHub repository](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic).

### Installation

For local installation you should have `npm` and `node` version 18 or higher.

- Clone https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic.
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm test` to run the test suite.

### Run Examples

After installation, you can run examples locally from a DuckDB server.

- Run `npm run server` to launch a local DuckDB server.
- Run `npm run dev` to start a dev web server with examples.
  The `socket` and `rest` connectors will only work if a local DuckDB server is running.
