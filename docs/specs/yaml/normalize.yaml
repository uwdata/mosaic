  description: |
    What is the return on investment for different days?
    Hover over the chart to normalize the stock prices for the percentage
    return on a given day.
    A `nearestX` interactor selects the nearest date, and parameterized
    expressions reactively update in response.

  stocks: { file: data/stocks.csv }
  labels: SELECT MAX(Date) as Date, ARGMAX(Close, Date) AS Close, Symbol
          FROM stocks GROUP BY Symbol
