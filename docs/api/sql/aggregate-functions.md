# Aggregate Functions

SQL aggregate function expressions.

## AggregateFunction {#aggregate-function}

The `AggregateFunction` class represents an aggregate function.
It includes a non-null `aggregate` property indicating an aggregate expression.
Users should not need to instantiate `AggregateFunction` instances directly, but instead should use aggregate function methods such as [`count()`](#count), [`sum()`](#sum), _etc_.

### basis

`AggregateFunction.basis`

The `basis` property indicates an underlying table column that can serve as a selection target for this aggregate operation.


### label

`AggregateFunction.label`

The `label` property provides a descriptive text label.

### distinct

`AggregateFunction.distinct()`

Returns a new AggregateFunction instance that applies the aggregation over distinct values only.

### where

`AggregateFunction.where(filter)`

Returns a new AggregateFunction instance filtered according to a Boolean-valied _filter_ expression.

### window

`AggregateFunction.window()`

Returns a windowed version of this aggregate function as a new [WindowFunction](./window-functions#window-function) instance.

### partitionby

`AggregateFunction.partitionby(...expressions)`

Provide one or more _expressions_ by which to partition a windowed version of this aggregate function and returns a new [WindowFunction](./window-functions#window-function) instance.

### orderby

`AggregateFunction.orderby(...expressions)`

Provide one or more _expressions_ by which to sort a windowed version of this aggregate function and returns a new [WindowFunction](./window-functions#window-function) instance.

### rows

`WindowFunction.rows(expression)`

Provide a window "rows" frame specification as an array or array-valued _expression_ and returns a windowed version of this aggregate function as a new [WindowFunction](./window-functions#window-function) instance.
A "rows" window frame is insensitive to peer rows (those that are tied according to the [orderby](#orderby) criteria).
The frame expression should evaluate to a two-element array indicating the number of preceding or following rows.
A zero value (`0`) indicates the current row.
A non-finite value (including `null` and `undefined`) indicates either unbounded preceding row (for the first array entry) or unbounded following rows (for the second array entry).

### range

`WindowFunction.range(expression)`

Provide a window "range" frame specification as an array or array-valued _expression_ and returns a windowed version of this aggregate function as a new [WindowFunction](./window-functions#window-function) instance.
A "range" window grows to include peer rows (those that are tied according to the [orderby](#orderby) criteria).
The frame expression should evaluate to a two-element array indicating the number of preceding or following rows.
A zero value (`0`) indicates the current row.
A non-finite value (including `null` and `undefined`) indicates either unbounded preceding row (for the first array entry) or unbounded following rows (for the second array entry).
